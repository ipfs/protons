## Install

```console
$ npm i protons
```

`protons` contains the code to compile `.proto` files to `.ts` files and `protons-runtime` contains the code to do serialization/deserialization to `Uint8Array`s during application execution.

```console
$ npm install --save-dev protons
$ npm install --save protons-runtime
```

## Usage

First generate your `.ts` files:

```console
$ protons ./path/to/foo.proto ./path/to/output.ts
```

Then run tsc over them as normal:

```console
$ tsc
```

In your code import the generated classes and use them to transform to/from bytes:

```js
import { Foo } from './foo.js'

const foo = {
  message: 'hello world'
}

const encoded = Foo.encode(foo)
const decoded = Foo.decode(encoded)

console.info(decoded.message)
// 'hello world'
```

## Differences from protobuf.js

This module uses the internal reader/writer from `protobuf.js` as it is highly optimised and there's no point reinventing the wheel.

It does have one or two differences:

1. Supports `proto3` semantics only
2. All 64 bit values are represented as `BigInt`s and not `Long`s (e.g. `int64`, `uint64`, `sint64` etc)
3. Unset `optional` fields are set on the deserialized object forms as `undefined` instead of the default values
4. `singular` fields set to default values are not serialized and are set to default values when deserialized if not set - protobuf.js [diverges from the language guide](https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js/issues/1468#issuecomment-745177012) around this feature
5. `map` fields can have keys of any type - protobufs.js [only supports strings](https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js/issues/1203#issuecomment-488637338)
6. `map` fields are deserialized as ES6 `Map`s - protobuf.js uses `Object`s

## Missing features

Some features are missing `OneOf`s, etc due to them not being needed so far in ipfs/libp2p. If these features are important to you, please open PRs implementing them along with tests comparing the generated bytes to `protobuf.js` and `pbjs`.
